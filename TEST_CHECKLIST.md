# Testing Checklist for Auth Changes

## 1. Auth Provider Consolidation (Issue #23)
- [x] Removed duplicate auth providers
- [x] Single AuthContext is being used
- [ ] **Browser Test**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
  - [ ] Check that you can log in successfully
  - [ ] Check that auth state persists across page refreshes
  - [ ] Navigate to Admin Users page and verify it loads correctly

## 2. RLS Security (Issue #24)
**✅ Migration Applied**: The RLS security policies have been successfully applied to your database.

Test the following:
- [ ] **User Data Isolation**:
  - [ ] Create a game as User A
  - [ ] Log in as User B
  - [ ] Verify User B cannot see User A's game
  - [ ] Verify User B cannot modify User A's game

- [ ] **Admin Override**:
  - [ ] Log in as admin user
  - [ ] Verify admin can see all games
  - [ ] Verify admin can manage all games

## 3. Auth Flow Performance (Issue #25)
- [x] No artificial delays in console logs
- [ ] **Browser Test**:
  - [ ] Navigate to protected pages
  - [ ] Observe that loading states appear immediately
  - [ ] No 2-second wait before redirect
  - [ ] Auth state updates are instant

## Quick Test Flow:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in incognito/private window
2. You should be redirected to login immediately (no 2-second delay)
3. Log in with your credentials
4. You should be redirected to home page quickly
5. Refresh the page - auth should persist without delays
6. Navigate to different pages - should be instant
7. Click logout and verify immediate redirect to login

## Console Indicators of Success:
- ✅ No "Wait timer completed" messages
- ✅ No "No session after timeout" messages  
- ✅ "Auth state: authInitialized: true" appears quickly
- ✅ No setTimeout calls in auth flow
