# ChatGPT Integration for Question Set Creation

## Overview
This feature will integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT API to assist users in creating question sets by generating intelligent suggestions for names and descriptions based on the selected songs.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. AI-Assisted Name Generation
- Generate creative, contextual names based on:
  - Selected songs' artists, genres, and eras
  - Common themes across the songs
  - Game difficulty level
  - Game type (Guess Artist vs Guess Song)

### 2. AI-Assisted Description Generation
- Create engaging descriptions that:
  - Summarize the musical theme/genre
  - Highlight notable artists or songs
  - Mention the era or time period
  - Include difficulty hints
  - Are SEO-friendly for public sets

## Technical Architecture

### API Integration
1. **Backend API Route**: `/api/ai/question-set-suggestions`
   - Accepts: selected songs data, game type, difficulty
   - Returns: name suggestions and description
   - Implements rate limiting and caching

2. **OpenAI Configuration**
   - Use GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo based on cost/performance
   - Structured prompts for consistent output
   - Temperature settings for creativity balance

### Security Considerations
1. **API Key Management**
   - Store OpenAI API key in environment variables
   - Never expose key to client-side code
   - Implement request validation

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limit requests per user per hour
   - Cache responses to reduce API calls
   - Implement cost tracking

## UI/UX Design

### Integration Points
1. **"Get AI Suggestions" Button**
   - Located near name/description fields
   - Shows loading state during generation
   - Disabled if no songs selected

2. **Suggestion Display**
   - Modal or inline display
   - Multiple name options (3-5)
   - Single description with edit capability
   - "Regenerate" option

3. **User Flow**
   - User selects songs â†’ Clicks "Get AI Suggestions"
   - AI generates contextual suggestions
   - User can accept, modify, or regenerate
   - Maintains user control over final content

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Setup
1. Create OpenAI API integration service
2. Design prompt templates
3. Implement API endpoint with proper error handling
4. Add environment variable configuration

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
1. Add AI suggestion button to question set builder
2. Create suggestion display component
3. Implement loading and error states
4. Add analytics tracking

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Learn from user selections to improve prompts
2. Add genre-specific prompt variations
3. Implement suggestion history
4. Add A/B testing for prompt effectiveness

## Example Prompts

### Name Generation Prompt
```
Generate 5 creative names for a music quiz question set with these characteristics:

## Cost Estimation
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per request
- Expected usage: 100-500 requests/day
- Monthly cost: $6-30
- Consider implementing credits/limits for free users
