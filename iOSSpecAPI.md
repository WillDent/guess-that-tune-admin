# Guess That Tune - Playlist-Based Home Page Specification

## Overview
This specification defines a new home page design that replaces the original game interface with a playlist selection system. Users select categorized playlists that launch the alternate game mode (artist guessing game).

## Architecture Overview
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **API Pattern**: RESTful with JSON responses
- **Client**: iOS App (SwiftUI)

## User Flow
1. **Home Page** â†’ View categorized playlists
2. **Playlist Selection** â†’ Tap playlist card
3. **Playlist Detail Page** â†’ View details, leaderboard, start game
4. **Game Play** â†’ Alternate game mode with selected playlist
5. **Results Screen** â†’ Score, XP earned, share options

## Home Page Structure

### Header Section
- **Player Avatar** (image URL from API)
- **Username** (string)
- **Current Level** (integer, starts at 0)
- **Total Score** (integer)
- **Settings Button** (navigates to settings)
- **Notifications Icon** (with badge count for unread)

### Content Sections
Dynamic categories provided by API, each containing:
- **Category Name** (e.g., "GENRE", "ERA", "VIBES")
- **Category Icon** (emoji or icon identifier)
- **VIEW ALL** button (links to paginated view)
- **Up to 4 playlist cards** per category

### Playlist Card Display
Each card shows:
- **Playlist Name**
- **Icon/Emoji** (from API)
- **Background** (gradient/image from app assets)
- **Player Count** (unique players who played)
- **Play Count** (total times played)
- **Visual State Badge** (NEW, TRENDING, LOCKED)

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Error Messages
1. **Corrupt/Missing Playlist Data**: "Oops, this is embarrassing. Please try another playlist."
2. **No Internet Connection**: "An internet connection is required to play."
3. **API Errors**: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

### Error Reporting
All errors should be logged to `/api/error/log` endpoint for tracking.

## Game States and Rules

### Playlist Locking
- Playlists can be locked based on player level
- Locked playlists show "Unlocks at Level X" message
- If player level decreases, previously unlocked playlists become locked again

### Experience Points Calculation (API-side)
XP awarded based on:
- **Completion Percentage**: (correctTracks / totalTracks) * baseXP
- **Perfect Score Bonus**: Additional XP for 100% accuracy
- **Time Bonus**: Faster completion grants bonus XP
- **Level Requirements**: Increasing XP needed per level (e.g., Level 1: 100 XP, Level 2: 250 XP, Level 3: 500 XP)

### Visual States
- **NEW**: Playlist added within last 7 days
- **TRENDING**: High play count in recent period
- **LOCKED**: Requires higher player level

## UI Behaviors

### Home Page
- Load user profile and home data on app launch
- Show skeleton loaders while loading
- Display maximum 4 playlists per category
- "VIEW ALL" navigates to category-specific view

### Category View (VIEW ALL)
- Initial load: 10 playlists
- Infinite scroll: Load 10 more when near bottom
- Show skeleton loaders during pagination
- Sort by newest first

### Playlist Detail Page
- Show all playlist information
- Display top 5 leaderboard entries
- "START GAME" button (disabled if locked)
- Back button returns to home page

### Results Screen
- Display final score and statistics
- Show XP earned with level progress
- Share button with pre-formatted text
- Options: Play Again, Share, Return to Home

### Notifications
- Badge shows unread count
- Notifications expire after 30 days
- Tap notification to view relevant playlist
- Mark as read when viewed

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Cache home page data for quick loading
- Implement pull-to-refresh on home page
- Preload playlist details when possible

### Security
- All API calls require valid JWT token
- Validate playlist access against user level
- Implement rate limiting for error reporting

### Offline Behavior
- Show cached home page if available
- Display connection error for all actions
- Queue score submissions for when online (optional enhancement)

## Future Enhancements (Not in V1)
- Friend challenges
- Daily rewards
- Achievement system
- Custom playlists
- Multiplayer mode
- Additional notification types
- Filtering and search functionality
