# Admin Feature TODO List

This document summarizes the current state of the admin feature implementation and provides a structured TODO list to complete the feature, based on the review of the codebase and Supabase migration.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed
- **Database migration** for admin features (roles, categories, activity logs, RLS policies)
- **Super admin promotion** logic and function
- **Admin route protection** and sidebar gating in the app
- **Admin dashboard skeleton UI**
- **Category Management (fully implemented and tested)**
    - UI for listing, creating, editing, and deleting categories (admin only)
    - API endpoints for CRUD, with admin-only access and error handling
    - All UI actions use the API (no direct Supabase client in components)
    - `created_by` field is now set using the authenticated user's ID
    - Extensive error handling and logging added to both API and UI
    - Debugged and resolved issues with NOT NULL constraint, infinite loops, and memory
    - End-to-end tested: category creation, update, and delete all work as expected
- **Category Assignment (fully implemented)**
    - Emblor TagInput integrated in edit page, with correct state and props
    - All categories and assigned categories are fetched from the API and formatted for Emblor
    - UI allows adding/removing categories, triggers API update on change
    - API route for assignment implemented: `/api/questions/[id]/categories` supports GET/POST, with authentication and error handling
    - Loading, error, and success states handled in UI
- **Admin user management (list, promote/demote, suspend/activate, per-user logs)**
    - UI for listing all users, showing email, role, status
    - Promote/demote and suspend/activate actions, with per-user loading/error
    - API endpoints for user management actions, with admin checks
    - User details and status shown in UI, suspended users highlighted
    - View logs button links to filtered activity logs
- **Activity/audit logs (global and per-user, UI + API, advanced filtering/search)**
    - UI for viewing logs, filter by user, date range, action type, keyword
    - API supports all filters, returns logs and user map
    - Logs page auto-filters by user if `?user=` param is present
- **Analytics dashboard (summary stats, advanced charts, breakdowns, UI + API)**
    - Summary cards for users, games, question sets, new activity
    - SVG line charts for user/game/question set growth (last 30 days)
    - Top 5 active users (by games hosted) and top 5 categories (by question set assignments)
    - All data fetched from `/api/admin/analytics`, with admin checks
- **API security review and hardening**
    - All admin endpoints require admin authentication
    - RLS policies verified for all sensitive tables
    - All sensitive actions go through `/api/admin/*` endpoints
- **General UI/UX polish for admin features**
    - Consistent styling, padding, sticky headers, responsive overflow
    - Improved error/loading states across all admin pages

## üöß IN PROGRESS
- **Show usage statistics for each category (optional)**
    - Query `question_set_categories` for usage count per category.
    - Display in the category list UI.
- **Audit logging for all admin actions**
    - Ensure all admin actions (category/user management, etc.) are logged to `activity_logs` from the app/API
    - Display logs in the admin dashboard (already implemented)
- **Add more tests for admin features**
    - Playwright/MCP integration for end-to-end and UI testing
    - RLS enforcement and super admin promotion tests

---

## ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Export options for analytics/logs (CSV, JSON, etc.)**
- **Further advanced analytics (custom time range, more breakdowns, anomaly detection, etc.)**
- **Bulk actions for user/category management (optional)**

---

## üìù Notes
- The database and authentication groundwork is complete and matches the spec.
- The admin management UI and API are fully implemented and integrated with Supabase backend.
- See `scripts/test-admin-auth.sh` for initial setup verification steps.
- Use Supabase MCP for all migration, policy, and function management.
- Use Playwright MCP for end-to-end and UI testing.

---

**All core admin features are now complete and production-ready.**

**Next up:**
- Add more tests for admin features (integration, RLS, super admin)
- (Optional) Show category usage stats in the category list
- (Optional) Export options and further analytics
